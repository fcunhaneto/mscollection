#MSCollection

##Which is

The application was created by my need to keep database of my DVD and Blu-ray, what was to be a simple list of titles ended up becoming larger than imagined were included in the database directors, categories, casts, lists of episodes per season and more, all being very easy to include because the MSCollection can do scraping of pages of the site  [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/) for those who speak English or the sites [Adoro Cinema](http://www.adorocinema.com/) and [Minha SÃ©rie](https://www.minhaserie.com.br/)  for Portuguese language.

Currently the MSCollection has a Linux-only version in the Portuguese language, but it can be easily translated by editing a single file or _texts.py_.

As soon as I have more time I want to make improvements to launch an English version and also a version compatible with Windows.

To install it follow the steps below, to use it in the _doc_ directory there is the instruction manual with versions in html and pdf.

##Installation

To install MSCollection on most Linux distributions, simply enter the directory in MSCollection and type:
```bash
$ ./install.sh
```

After installation the application opens automatically, to open it again just by entering the directory in the MSCollection directory and typing:
```bash
$ ./mscollection.py
```
